const letters = [
  {
    id: 1,
    title: "Letter 1: Why I Fell",
    content: "When I first saw you...",
    unlockPosition: 0.2, // 20% down page

    title: "Letter 2: Every Day",
    content: "Every single day...",
    unlockPosition: 0.5,
    emoji: "💕"
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    title: "Letter 3: Forever",
    content: "I want to spend forever...",
    unlockPosition: 0.8,

## 🎬 ADVANCED ANIMATIONS TO ADD

### A. **SCROLL-TRIGGERED TEXT REVEALS** (10 mins per section)
```typescript
// Make text appear character by character on scroll
// Use framer motion + useInView
// Stagger letters for dramatic effect

<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
  whileInView={{ opacity: 1 }}
  viewport={{ once: true }}
>
  {text.split('').map((char, i) => (
    <motion.span
      key={i}
      initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
      whileInView={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
      transition={{ delay: i * 0.05 }}
    >
      {char}
    </motion.span>
  ))}
</motion.div>
```

### B. **PARALLAX DEPTH EFFECT** (20 mins)
```typescript
// Different sections move at different scroll speeds
// Creates 3D depth feeling
// Use useScroll from framer motion

const { scrollY } = useScroll()
const y = useTransform(scrollY, [0, 500], [0, -100])

<motion.div style={{ y }}>
  Content that moves slower
</motion.div>
```

### C. **MORPHING SHAPES BETWEEN SECTIONS** (30 mins)
```typescript
// SVG paths that morph/transition
// Use framer motion layoutId
// Create flowing transitions
// Beautiful section dividers

<motion.svg layoutId="divider">
  <path d="M 0 100 Q 250 50 500 100" />
</motion.svg>
```

### D. **PARTICLE EFFECTS FOR CELEBRATIONS** (15 mins)
```typescript
// When quiz is completed
// When letter opens
// When milestone reached
// When she views a special message

const createParticles = (x, y) => {
  for (let i = 0; i < 30; i++) {
    createParticle({
      x, y,
      vx: (Math.random() - 0.5) * 8,
      vy: (Math.random() - 0.5) * 8,
      duration: 1000
    })
  }
}
```

  letterOpen: '/audio/paper-rustle.mp3',
  quizWrong: '/audio/buzzer.mp3',

}

// Play sound on interaction:
const playSound = (soundKey) => {
  const audio = new Audio(sounds[soundKey])
  audio.volume = 0.3 // Keep subtle
  audio.play().catch(() => {}) // Silent fail
}
```

### Add Background Music:
